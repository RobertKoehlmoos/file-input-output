In the sample text folder you will find a file named "nums.json". It is a list of numbers stored in JSON format.
Create a new file named "nums_squares_map.json" in the sample text folder that contains a dictionary of all the numbers
in the first json as keys mapped to their values squared.
Don't worry about the json module automatically converting integers to strings when you store it.

In the sample_text folder you will find a file named "sonnets.txt". This file contains (almost) all the
sonnets written by William Shakespeare in a numbered order.

Create a new folder named "sonnets", and store each sonnet in it as a separate file named "sonnet_x.txt" where the x
is replaced with the sonnet number. The contents of each file should be only the lines of text for each sonnet, so
you don't need the empty lines above or below. Don't forget to have a newline at the end of the last line (that
should make things easier rather than harder)

In the sample_text folder you will find a file named "iso_8859-1.txt". This file contains a list of the
hexadecimal representation of commonly used characters.

The hex values and descriptions are currently in two columns.
Write a function that converts this file to have all hex values and description in a single column,
shifting the second column to continue immediately under the first.

Then write a function that converts it back to how it was.

Yes, you could just store a string copy of the entire file you want to write in your function. You are very clever. Don't do that.
You probably want to save a safe copy of the original on the indescribably small chance you mess it up along the way.
